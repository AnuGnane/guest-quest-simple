# Guest Quest - Simple Version

A simplified multiplayer "Guess Who" style game built incrementally.

## Project Goals
- Simple, clean codebase that's easy to understand and extend
- Local development first, deployment later
- Build and test incrementally
- Minimal dependencies

## Current Status
- âœ… Basic multiplayer game functionality complete
- âœ… Enhanced character sets with attributes
- âœ… Character set selection (Classic & Superheroes)
- ðŸš§ Continuing to add features incrementally

## Tech Stack (Minimal)
- **Frontend**: Vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript (no frameworks initially)
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express (minimal setup)
- **Real-time**: WebSockets (native, no Socket.IO initially)
- **Data**: In-memory storage (no database initially)

## Getting Started
```bash
npm install
npm start
```

## Development Approach
We'll build this step by step:
1. âœ… Basic HTML page with game interface
2. âœ… Simple Node.js server
3. âœ… WebSocket connection
4. âœ… Game logic implementation
5. âœ… Enhanced character sets
6. ðŸš§ Polish and enhance

This keeps things simple and testable at each step.
