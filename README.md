# Guest Quest - Simple Version

A simplified multiplayer "Guess Who" style game built incrementally.

## Project Goals
- Simple, clean codebase that's easy to understand and extend
- Local development first, deployment later
- Build and test incrementally
- Minimal dependencies

## Current Status
- ðŸš§ Project setup in progress

## Tech Stack (Minimal)
- **Frontend**: Vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript (no frameworks initially)
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express (minimal setup)
- **Real-time**: WebSockets (native, no Socket.IO initially)
- **Data**: In-memory storage (no database initially)

## Getting Started
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Development Approach
We'll build this step by step:
1. Basic HTML page with game interface
2. Simple Node.js server
3. WebSocket connection
4. Game logic implementation
5. Polish and enhance

This keeps things simple and testable at each step.
